## What is the difference?
Entwine is a sort of cousin to Traversal. Both allowed progression through interactive stories and documents. Entwine's method renders document sections one-at-a-time, showing the active section and transitioning into other sections based on user choices. Traversal renders all sections on an infinite canvas and moves, pans and zooms based on section transforms.
